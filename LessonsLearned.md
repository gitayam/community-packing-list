**Best Practice**: Use grep search to find all references to removed URLs across all template files before deploying changes

## Git Workflow and Commit Practices

### 1. **Auto Staging and Committing After Testing**
- First run git status to see the items that are uncommited. 
- Always stage and commit your changes after you have tested them locally, but do **not** push immediately. This allows for local version control and easy rollback if needed, while preventing unreviewed code from reaching shared branches.

### 2. **Descriptive, Searchable Commit Messages**
- Use brief but descriptive commit messages that summarize the change and its purpose. Good commit messages make it easier to search and understand the project history in the future.
- Example: `fix: correct helmet item quantity in Ranger packing list migration`

### 3. **Never Commit Sensitive Files**
- Never commit your `.env` file or any other file containing secrets or environment-specific configuration. Use `.env-example` for structure and documentation, and add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Server-side operations are crucial** - Don't send more data than necessary to the frontend
2. **User experience matters** - Provide search, filters, and export options for large datasets
3. **Consistent error handling** - Always provide meaningful feedback to users
4. **Mobile-first design** - Ensure responsive design from the start
5. **Proper git hygiene** - Keep sensitive data out of repositories
6. **Comprehensive testing** - Test all components thoroughly to prevent regressions
7. **Modular architecture** - Use modals and AJAX for better user experience
8. **Performance considerations** - Implement filtering and pagination early
9. **Documentation** - Keep README and code comments up to date
10. **Migration management** - Always create and test database migrations
11. **Thorough cleanup** - When removing features, search and update all template references to prevent broken URLs

## Development Patterns

### Frontend Development
- Use consistent CSS classes and avoid inline styles; extract page-specific inline styles into `src/styles/main.css` utilities.
- Implement loading states for all AJAX operations.
- Provide keyboard accessibility (ESC to close modals, focus trap, restore focus to trigger).
- Use SVG icons instead of emojis for professional appearance; include `aria-label` on icon-only buttons.
- Prefer toggling visibility with utility classes (e.g., `hidden`) instead of inline `style` attributes for easier state control.

### Backend Development
- Implement proper form validation and error handling.
- Use Django's built-in security features.
- Create comprehensive test suites.
- Handle edge cases in parsers and data processing.
- Gate mutating actions (create/edit Stores, create/merge/delete/clone Packing Lists) behind authentication.
- Allow anonymous price submissions with rate limiting and trust scoring; mask IPs in UI (partial hash).
- Provide time-series endpoints for items’ price history to enable macro analysis.

### UI State & Preferences
- Persist non-sensitive UI preferences such as list view mode and dark mode in `localStorage` for better user experience.

### Accessibility Testing
- Run axe DevTools on key pages (Home, Lists, Items, Packing List Detail) and treat critical/serious issues as blockers.

### Database Management
- Always create migrations for schema changes
- Test migrations on sample data
- Use proper field types and constraints
- Implement proper relationships between models

## GitHub Issue Creation Best Practice

When creating a GitHub issue:
- First, create a temporary markdown file to stage the issue content.
- List all existing labels in the file and check if the needed labels exist.
- Write and format the issue body clearly in markdown, including all relevant sections (description, steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, environment, etc.).
- Use the markdown file to create the issue via the GitHub CLI, applying the correct labels.
- After the issue is created, delete the temporary markdown file to keep the repo clean.

This ensures issues are well-formatted, label-aware, and the process is repeatable and organized.
