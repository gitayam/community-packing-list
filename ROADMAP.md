   - ‚úÖ Embeddable widget view (`/embed/<slug>/`) for iframe integration
   - ‚úÖ Community discovery page (`/discover/`) with search and filtering
   - ‚úÖ Error handling templates (list_not_found.html, embed_not_found.html)

3. **Social Media Integration**
   - ‚úÖ Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Email sharing buttons
   - ‚úÖ Open Graph meta tags for rich social media previews

## üö® **IMMEDIATE ISSUE TO RESOLVE NEXT SESSION**

### Problem: 500 Server Error on Cloud Run Deployment

**Status**: Cloud Run service returns 500 errors despite successful deployment and migration completion.

**Symptoms**:
- ‚úÖ Local development works fine
- ‚úÖ All tests pass locally (23/23 sharing tests + core app tests)
- ‚úÖ Database migrations complete successfully on cloud
- ‚ùå Cloud Run deployment returns 500 on all endpoints
- ‚ùå Both home page and sharing endpoints affected

**Investigation Progress**:
- [x] Added defensive checks in model methods for field existence
- [x] Fixed migration with proper default values
- [x] Temporarily disabled sharing UI (didn't resolve issue)
- [x] Applied database migrations via Cloud Run jobs
- [x] Generated share slugs for existing data
- [ ] **NEXT**: Debug the actual Python error in Cloud Run logs

**Debugging Steps for Next Session**:
1. **Get detailed error logs**: `gcloud logging read` with proper filters to see Python tracebacks
2. **Run health check job**: Execute `debug_check.py` to identify specific model/database issues
3. **Check environment differences**: Compare local vs cloud settings, dependencies, Python versions
4. **Database schema verification**: Ensure all migrations applied correctly in cloud database
5. **Rollback option**: Revert to last working deployment if needed to maintain service

**Files to Check**:
- `/packing_lists/views.py` (sharing view implementations)
- `/packing_lists/models.py` (defensive checks for new fields)
- `/community_packing_list/settings_cloud.py` (cloud-specific settings)
- Migration files and database schema
