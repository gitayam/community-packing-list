    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>The Military Gear Pricer is a community-driven platform designed to help military personnel find the best prices for items on their packing lists. With numerous shops selling gear at varying prices, it can be challenging to get everything you need efficiently and affordably.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>This application allows users (even without an account) to contribute by adding current prices for specific military gear items from different stores. Here's a quick overview:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Browse Items:</strong> View a list of common packing list items.</li>
        <li><strong>View Prices:</strong> See prices submitted by other users, sorted by price and submission date to help you find the best deals.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Prices:</strong> Contribute by adding new prices you've found. You can do this anonymously or provide a name.</li>
        <li><strong>Vote on Submissions:</strong> Upvote helpful and accurate price submissions, or downvote outdated or incorrect ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Reputation:</strong> Users who provide names with their submissions earn a reputation score based on the community's votes on their contributions. This helps identify reliable sources of information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>This application is built using modern web technologies, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python (as the primary programming language)</li>
        <li>Django (as the web framework)</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL (for the database)</li>
        <li>Docker & Docker Compose (for containerization and development environment)</li>
        <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for the frontend presentation and interactivity)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We aim to provide a simple, effective tool for the military community.</p>
